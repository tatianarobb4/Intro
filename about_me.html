                <h2>My background</h2>
                <p> I was born in Brooklyn and spent almost every weekend in Coney Island (since I have family there). I grew up in the 
                    suburbs of North Carolina. I am a middle child and an aunt. As well as the second shortest :( As a teenager, I went to 
                    a dual-enrollment high school and graduated with an associates in art. Which is cute. I'm a rising senior 
                    studying Linguistics, yet I have no intention of making that my career (I don't know what I'd want a career in). That's
                    pretty much my background! 
                </p>

                <h2>My interests</h2>
                <p>
                    The things that interest me are nothing special. My interests include: music, reading (sometimes bad) romance novels, 
                    *mystical things*, random crafting/art things, taking a computer science class once a year, and watching kdramas.
                    There's more of course, but I can't think of anything else.

                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>
                    What more can I say. I like books. I like romance. And two years ago, I found an author that gave me both in the worst
                    way possible. Her name is Jasmine Guillory. Please read one (1) of her books and come back to me.
                </p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I like a variety of R&B music. As well as pop, indie, reggae, and oldies. Some artists that I love are Mereba, Kelela, 
                    Solange, Moses Sumney, Hoody, Rina Sawayama, Janet Jackson, Megan Thee Stallion, and a lot others. Although I love music, I 
                    can't play an instrument. In middle school, I played the clarinet in band but that didn't work out. I quit because I couldn't
                    make a certain note. Lately I've been wanting to learn the piano, to vibe, but our keyboard was recently donated.

                <h3>Mystical Things</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm just being dramatic. Nothing really mystical, it's just astrology and tarot. I've always loved witchy things as a kid.
                    When I was 15, I started learning about astrology as a hobby. Now I'm 21 and it's still a hobby, but I started to study it
                    a lot more seriously once the pandemic started. It's maybe one of my favorite things to learn about. Also don't use 
                    costar!!!! We don't like her. P.S.
