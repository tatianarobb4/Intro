# Animated GIF Assignment

Welcome! In this workshop, students will team up to create a video documentary using iMovie on iPhone or Mac, the equivalent on Windows, or any free video editing software of your choice, and publish it on your web pages. Your video will include a voiceover track and soundtrack produced in Audacity.

## Requirements

Do the following:

### Video requirements

Your video must...

- be a result of teamwork of 3 members.
- be a documentary related in some way to your group's personal and collective experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic
- be 3-5 minutes long
- be entirely filmed in landscape mode on your phone or other device
- include the following soviet montage techniques: a) one example of Eisenstein's intellectual montage technique; b) two examples of other Soviet montage techniques of your choice
- include at least two interviews of people outside your team, in person (as long as safe), or via Zoom using screen videocapture software
- include a voiceover narration track
- include a discrete musical soundtrack, faded in and out as appropriate, in a way that does not interfere with the voiceover and other sound of the film
- include sound effects, done tactfully, where appropriate

### Post-production editing requirements

- you must use a digital audio editing app, like Audacity, to record a voiceover , musical soundtrack, and sound effects that add depth to your video.
- experiment with [transitions](http://mentalfloss.com/article/21028/5-film-transitions-worth-knowing) between shots, such as dissolves, fades and wipes
- take inspiration from the masters. The montage technique you're doing in this workshop has a long history.

### Publishing requirements

The video must be published onto a web page named `video.html`.

- this page must be linked from your personal web site's home page.

Publishing a video:

- the video should be loadable on your web pages within a 'reasonable' amount of time, so make the file size 'reasonable'
- publish your video in `ogv` and `mp4` formats to increase the chances that it will play properly in contemporary web browsers.

* if you need to convert between video formats, or compress your video, use a free video conversion tool, such as [https://handbrake.fr/](Handbrake)

### Additional suggestions

You are welcome to incorporate other types of content into your videos, such as:

- found footage
- screen capture of animation or programs running in your computer or device
- titles or other text content

### Copy existing web site files

The work you do in this assignment will be published to the same directory where your current web site currently exists. To prevent you from accidentally deleting any of your existing web site files, copy all the files from your existing web site into the main project directory for this assignment. This means copying any existing HTML, CSS, images, and other files and directories so a copy exists within this project directory. Then we will be able to upload everything in this directory to the web server and replace all existing files without worry about losing anything.

## Submit your work

In order to submit this assignment, you must publish all modified files to the web and upload the code to GitHub.

### Upload the web page to a web server

Upload all files you have created to a web server. Your instructor will have given you instructions for how to do this.

Take note of the web address (URL) of your web page - this is the address that can be plugged into the address bar of any web browser for the web browser to load and display your web page.

### Update the settings.json file

Make sure your name, NYU Net ID, and the exact URL of your web site's home page are placed into the `settings.json` file in the appropriate places. Make sure the URL works when plugged into a web browser beforehand.

### Submit your work on GitHub

You are now ready to submit this assignment. You can do so directly from Visual Studio Code with the following steps, in the indicated order:

1. Switch to the Source Control view in Visual Studio Code - this view will show you a list of the files you have modified.
1. In the "`Message`" text field towards the top-left, enter a unique message to yourself about what you have changed and, while still with the text field selected, type `Command`-`Enter` on Mac OS X, or `Control`-`Enter` on Windows, to "commit" the changes you've made with this custom message. If you forget to hit `Command`-`Enter` after typing the message, you can instead click the "`...`" button above the message field and click the "`Commit all`" option in the menu that appears.
1. Now, click the "`...`" button above the message field and click the "`Push`" option in the menu that appears - this will upload your changes to your personal code repository on GitHub.

You have now submitted your completed assignment. Your changes are now posted to GitHub.com, where the instructor and graders can access it. Your `settings.json` file has information about who you are and where we can view your page on the web.

You can verify all this yourself manually by visiting your repository on GitHub.com and making sure the code displayed there is what you submitted.
