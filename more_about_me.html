                <h2>That extra thing I wanted to say</h2>
                <p>
                    This page is dedicated to one of my favorite things (and I have a lot of favorites): bears! They are the best animals 
                    ever. No one can change my mind. Bears are incredibly smart, cute, hairy, dangerous, adorable, protective, and they just
                    have good energy. There is just too much bear media in my life to not love them. When I was a baby, I was gifted a huge 
                    teddy bear (and his son). I grew up watching a lot of Yogi Bear on Boomerang and learning about fire safety from Smokey 
                    the Bear. I was in love with the movie Brother Bear and kind of liked Brave. Recently, my new favorite piece of bear 
                    media is the Cartoon Network show 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Bare_Bears">We Bare Bears</a>. 
                    An incredibly wholesome show about three bears (that are brothers!!!) living in San Francisco.

                <p> Look at these bears!!! You cannot tell me they aren't just the cutest things. I didn't
                    realize that I had unintentionally choose two pictures with a bear with flowers. They look
                    incredibly Venusian.
